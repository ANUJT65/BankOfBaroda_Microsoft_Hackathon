## Problem Statement

The banking industry faces significant challenges in operational efficiency, particularly in repetitive administrative tasks and lengthy loan approval processes. Our project, Walter White, aims to address these challenges by creating a centralized dashboard that leverages Generative AI and Machine Learning.
 The main goals of the Walter White dashboard are to:
 
- **Streamline Loan Approvals:** Automate the loan approval process, reducing approval time from weeks to days(reducing the approval time for business loan approvals which take weeks, and also reducing the personal loan approvals which take upto some days).
- **Retrieve and Analyze Customer Data:** Automatically fetch, store, and process customer data to support informed decision-making.
- **Perform Repetitive Calculations:** Automate financial calculations and metrics to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
- **Categorize and Respond to Emails:** Use AI to classify incoming emails and generate appropriate responses, improving communication efficiency.

## Prerequisites for understanding the project/Various considerations in project

### 1.Loan Approvals
## Business Loans
The parameters for giving business loans are very different from personal loans. The parameters considered include:
- Income tax returns
- Audited balance sheets

## Detailed Workflow


## For removing any confusion before we start :
- 1) Inputs can be through ocr , csvs and pdfs and even keyboard inputs for making it easy for customers to access the dashboard (Customer is king as they always say )
 - 2) Azure Blob storage is for storing documents.
- 3) Azure sql database is for storing structured information from documents and inputs.

## Customer side:
## Desc of below image:
- As you can see in image, customers just have to attach their financial documents and azure ocr will do the work for them of filling the forms aswell as form recognition .
- This really improves engagement of users and makes the financial process less stressful.

![Wireframe - 6](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/c4381e5d-7989-43ea-83af-2659ec15d6cf)

## Desc of below image:
- This is the centralized dashboard for customer side where they can track their applications and whether they are approved or not.
-  Here you could see attachments necessary for businesses / customers which are all stored in bank database with automated calculations(specially balance sheets) 
    ensuring that customers dont have to deal with these.
![Wireframe - 5](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/e5dfce72-5e7a-4970-8332-23e37c652210)



## Banker Side:
## Desc:
- We can see how applications are categorised using ml model and  even a loan approval score is calculated so that they could be approved or declined.
- Even mails could be sent as shown below to customers through the dashboard itself to user on the basis of risk,
  like much more interest rate for risky users or rejection mails etc
  
![Wireframe - 2](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/bd72c41d-ef22-4a80-a86a-936aee510497)

## Desc:
- Here we could see categorization of incoming emails, which could be handled by respective departments and queries could be solved immediately boosting customer confidence.
![Wireframe - 3](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/128c5c3c-966d-449d-859f-1ea5e7d6ba1b)

#### Desc:
- This is one of our more innovative way of using generative ai where you could query the  database in natural language and get access to **read only** information
- Here you could also do analytics of the attached document or retrieved documents using pandas agent and azure gen ai whose basic implementation is provided in 
  this repo.
![Wireframe - 4](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/df72e034-e677-4f6d-862c-0b1d517d690f)

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical component of the Walter White Dashboard. We are leveraging several security measures and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our system. Below are the key security considerations implemented in our project:

### 1) Authentication and Authorization

- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)**: We use MSAL for secure user authentication and authorization. This allows users to authenticate using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
  - [Authentication with Azure AD and React](https://adrianhynes.medium.com/authentication-with-azure-ad-and-react-ced9a829e083)
  - [Secure Your React.js Web Application with Azure AD Authentication Using MSAL Library](https://medium.com/@isuruariyarathna2k00/secure-your-react-js-web-application-with-azure-ad-authentication-using-masl-library-7f578c65f209)

### 2) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: We implement MFA to add an extra layer of security. Options include:
  - **Email OTP**: Sending a one-time password to the user's registered email address.
  - **Microsoft Authenticator App**: Using the app for code generation, which must be entered along with the password.
  - [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)

### 3) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different roles have different levels of access:
  - **Bank Manager**: Full access to all emails, chat records, and loan applications.
  - **Employees**: Limited access to view emails assigned to them and approve/decline loan applications without editing the database.
  - **Customers**: Access only to their own emails and loan applications.
  -  [Azure Role-Based Access Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

### 4) Data Security

- **Azure SQL Database**: Storing data securely using Azure SQL Database with encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Securely storing documents and forms in Azure Blob Storage.

### 5) Secure Data Transfer

- **HTTPS**: All data exchanges between the client and server are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6) Auditing and Monitoring

- **Audit Logs**: Implementing detailed audit logs to monitor access and changes to sensitive information. This helps in tracking and identifying any unauthorized access or modifications.
- **Azure Security Center**: Using Azure Security Center to continuously monitor and improve the security posture of our resources.

### 7) Verification of Auditing Agencies

- **Auditing Agency Verification**: Ensuring that balance sheets and financial documents are verified by reputable auditing agencies. This prevents fraud and enhances the trustworthiness of submitted documents.

By implementing these comprehensive security measures, we ensure that our system is robust against various security threats and complies with industry standards for data protection and privacy.
