## Problem Statement

The banking industry faces significant challenges in operational efficiency, particularly in repetitive administrative tasks and lengthy loan approval processes. Our project, Walter White, aims to address these challenges by creating a centralized dashboard that leverages Generative AI and Machine Learning. The main goals of the Walter White dashboard are to:

- **Retrieve and Analyze Customer Data:** Automatically fetch, store, and process customer data to support informed decision-making.
- **Perform Repetitive Calculations:** Automate financial calculations and metrics to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
- **Categorize and Respond to Emails:** Use AI to classify incoming emails and generate appropriate responses, improving communication efficiency.
- **Streamline Loan Approvals:** Automate the loan approval process, reducing approval time from weeks to days.

## Methodology

### Overview
The Walter White dashboard integrates various Azure services and machine learning models to automate and streamline banking operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how each component functions:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Input:** Business balance sheets (audited) in Excel format.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** Stores the uploaded Excel files.
- **Azure Functions:** Triggered when a new file is uploaded to Blob Storage.
  - **Action:** Read the Excel file, preprocess the data, and convert it to SQL database tables.

### 2. Financial Ratio Calculation
- **Azure SQL Database:** Performs key financial ratio calculations (e.g., current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio) using SQL queries.
  - **Reference:** [Credit Analysis Ratios](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/credit-analysis-ratio/)

### 3. External Data Integration
- **Azure Logic Apps:** Automates fetching news articles related to businesses using a News API.
- **Azure Cognitive Services:** Analyzes news sentiment and searches for pending legal cases.
  - **Reference:** [Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines](https://medium.com/@ramitsharma1994.rs/sentiment-analysis-of-news-headlines-with-microsoft-azure-cognitive-services-be3dedf3ccec)

### 4. Auditing Agency Verification
- **Verification Process:** Ensures that all financial and external data meet required standards.
  - **Reference:** [Satyam Scam Overview](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/satyam-scam)

### 5. Lang-Chain for Database Retrieval and analytics
- **Azure Functions:** Uses Lang-Chain and Azure AI for efficient database retrieval and analytics based on predefined prompts.
  - **Reference:** [Chat with MySQL using Python and LangChain](https://alejandro-ao.com/chat-with-mysql-using-python-and-langchain/)
  - reference 2: analytics

### 6. Loan Approval Process
- **Verification:** Checks if financial ratios, external data, and audit verifications meet thresholds.
- **Azure Functions:** Implements logic for threshold checks and validation.
- **Approval:** Grants loan approval if all checks are satisfactory.

### 7. Customer (Non-Businesses) Credit Score Calculation
- **Azure Machine Learning:** Uses an improved ML model to calculate credit scores for non-business customers.
  - **Reference:** [Credit Score Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/blob/main/backend/Credit_ScoreAnamolyDetection.ipynb)

### 8. Email Categorization and Response
- **Azure Cognitive Services:** Classifies incoming emails based on content and keywords and shows on dashboard
- **Azure Functions:** Generates and sends automated responses using Generative AI from centralized dashboard
