## Problem Statement

The banking industry faces significant challenges in operational efficiency, particularly in repetitive administrative tasks and lengthy loan approval processes. Our project, Walter White, aims to address these challenges by creating a centralized dashboard that leverages Generative AI and Machine Learning.
 The main goals of the Walter White dashboard are to:

- **Retrieve and Analyze Customer Data:** Automatically fetch, store, and process customer data to support informed decision-making.
- **Perform Repetitive Calculations:** Automate financial calculations and metrics to reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
- **Categorize and Respond to Emails:** Use AI to classify incoming emails and generate appropriate responses, improving communication efficiency.
- **Streamline Loan Approvals:** Automate the loan approval process, reducing approval time from weeks to days.

## Methodology

### Overview
The Walter White dashboard integrates various Azure services and machine learning models to automate and streamline banking operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how each component functions:


## Prerequisites

There are 3 types of operations we are  enhancing  in banks:

**All are very crucial in functioning of banks**

### 1. Business Loan Analytics
The parameters for giving business loans are very different from personal loans. The parameters considered include:
- Income tax returns
- Audited balance sheets

- [Audited Sheet example pdf](https://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/tatamotors/balance-sheetVI/TM03)
- [Audited Sheet inputs/parameters considered](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1voKSi_i6FulvfVyE1tcm8e6QSYBsdD8b/view?usp=sharing)

### 2. Personal Loan Analytics
The parameters considered for personal loans are detailed in the following PDF:

### 3. Email Classification and Categorization
This model categorizes and classifies emails sent to respective departments so that customers are prioritized and their queries are always resolved.

## Detailed Workflow


- For removing any confusion before we start :
 - Azure Blob storage is for storing documents.
- Azure sql database is for storing structured information from documents and inputs.
- Inputs can be through ocr , csvs and pdfs and even keyboard inputs for making it easy for customers to access the dashboard

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical component of the Walter White Dashboard. We are leveraging several security measures and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our system. Below are the key security considerations implemented in our project:

### 1) Authentication and Authorization

- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)**: We use MSAL for secure user authentication and authorization. This allows users to authenticate using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
  - [Authentication with Azure AD and React](https://adrianhynes.medium.com/authentication-with-azure-ad-and-react-ced9a829e083)
  - [Secure Your React.js Web Application with Azure AD Authentication Using MSAL Library](https://medium.com/@isuruariyarathna2k00/secure-your-react-js-web-application-with-azure-ad-authentication-using-masl-library-7f578c65f209)

### 2) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: We implement MFA to add an extra layer of security. Options include:
  - **Email OTP**: Sending a one-time password to the user's registered email address.
  - **Microsoft Authenticator App**: Using the app for code generation, which must be entered along with the password.
  - [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)

### 3) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different roles have different levels of access:
  - **Bank Manager**: Full access to all emails, chat records, and loan applications.
  - **Employees**: Limited access to view emails assigned to them and approve/decline loan applications without editing the database.
  - **Customers**: Access only to their own emails and loan applications.
  -  [Azure Role-Based Access Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

### 4) Data Security

- **Azure SQL Database**: Storing data securely using Azure SQL Database with encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Securely storing documents and forms in Azure Blob Storage.

### 5) Secure Data Transfer

- **HTTPS**: All data exchanges between the client and server are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6) Auditing and Monitoring

- **Audit Logs**: Implementing detailed audit logs to monitor access and changes to sensitive information. This helps in tracking and identifying any unauthorized access or modifications.
- **Azure Security Center**: Using Azure Security Center to continuously monitor and improve the security posture of our resources.

### 7) Verification of Auditing Agencies

- **Auditing Agency Verification**: Ensuring that balance sheets and financial documents are verified by reputable auditing agencies. This prevents fraud and enhances the trustworthiness of submitted documents.

By implementing these comprehensive security measures, we ensure that our system is robust against various security threats and complies with industry standards for data protection and privacy.
